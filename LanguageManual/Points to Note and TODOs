1. Semantic checks for function call parameters once functions grammar rules are implemented
2. error in testcase: string f3 = -"hello";
    Probably unary operator in declaration is not working
3. What do we do about all the warnings?
4. jump statements
5. Explicit and implicit type casting TAC?
6. Not able to do semantic analysis for for loop until the get_datatype method of the symbol table is implemented correctly - breaks in case of for loop
7. 

8.  for array reference of multi-dimensional arrays, we have to 
    multiply the index with all the previous dimensions - need to
    change it (shreetesh).
9.  store functions in symbol table, this means that in our language
    we have to declare/define the function before use
10. change function labels to be the same as function names
11. Semantic analysis for function definitions : check the return type
    and check if the value of the same type is being returned in the
    function body. (check inside if, else, etc.)
