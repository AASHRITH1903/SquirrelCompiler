Accidental Problems found during testing :

- [ ] Function calls with Array Variables - Aashrith - not working
- [ ] Array variable (char) arithmetic - Aashrith - not working
- [ ] Recursion inside for-loop - Aashrith - not working - stack error
- [ ] Bool assignment with logical operator - Aashrith - not working - wrong value
