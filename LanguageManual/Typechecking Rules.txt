- : -int, -float (works as is)
  : -str (Error)
  : -bool, -char  (cast to int)
! : !bool (works as is)
  : !str (Error)
  : !int, !char, !float (cast to bool)

BinaryOperator
* / + - : int and int, float and float (works as is, output int or float) 
        : int or bool or char and float (temporarily cast to float(via int), output float)
        : str on either side (Error)
        : bool or char and int (temporarily cast to int, output int)
        
> < >= <= == != : int and int, float and float (works as is)
                        : int or bool or char and float (temporarily cast to float(via int))
                        : str on either side (Error)
                        : bool or char and int (temporarily cast to int)
                        output always bool 

%  : int and int (works as is)
   : str or float on either side (Error)
   : bool or char or int (temporarily cast to int)
    output always int
 
&& || : bool and bool (works as is)
      : str or float on either side (Error)
      : int or bool or char (temporarily cast to bool)
        output always bool
=     if lhs == rhs, where neither are string -> typecast permanently to lhs if required, else do nothing
      if one is string but the other is not -> error 
      if both are string, do nothing

int a;
bool b;

if (a && b) {
    // do something
}

Corresponding TAC:

a = (int)0;
b = (bool)false;
